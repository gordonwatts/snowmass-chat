# Experimental

Some experimental efforts - short code snippets that try things out - and probably should be deleted before we go on too far.

Make sure to look at requirements.txt to see what else needs to be loaded

* `lc_archive_loader.py` Testing out the archive loader, getting as far as splitting, making sure we can write out/pickle files.
