questions:
- answer: The FASER experiment is capable of probing long-lived dark sectors in the
    Effective Field Theory (EFT) framework. It is designed to search for decays of
    new long-lived particles predicted by models of new physics. Additionally, FASER2,
    an upgrade of the FASER experiment, will search for light and weakly-interacting
    states, including long-lived particles, new force carriers, axion-like particles,
    light neutralinos, and dark sector particles.
  question: What does the FASER experiment do?
- answer: The MATHUSLA experiment is designed to explore a wide range of models related
    to dark matter by conducting experiments to explore the full mass range for dark
    matter in certain scenarios.
  question: What does the MATHUSLA experiment do?
- answer: The ATLAS experiment is a particle physics experiment at the Large Hadron
    Collider (LHC) at CERN. It is designed to explore a wide range of physics, including
    the search for the Higgs boson, extra dimensions, and other new phenomena. The
    experiment aims to understand the fundamental particles and forces that make up
    the universe.
  question: What does the ATLAS experiment do?
- answer: The CMS experiment is a collaboration of physicists, graduate students,
    engineers, technicians, and computer scientists from various universities and
    institutes. They work on the CMS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
    The CMS experiment has released research-quality data, including collision data
    and simulated data, for analysis. They have been involved in significant discoveries
    in high-energy physics, such as the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012. Additionally,
    they have training programs to engage and educate new collaborators, including
    undergraduate students.
  question: What does the CMS experiment do?
- answer: The LHCb experiment is a single-arm forward spectrometer at the Large Hadron
    Collider designed to study the properties of particles containing b and c quarks.
    It focuses on decays of bottom and charm quarks, as well as tau leptons. The experiment
    is competitive with general-purpose detectors for some new particle searches,
    particularly for Higgs decays into long-lived particles.
  question: What does the LHCb experiment do?
- answer: The CODEX-b experiment is designed to study long-lived particles (LLPs)
    using proven technology in a relatively compact and affordable manner. It aims
    to have competitive sensitivity to a wide range of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM)
    LLP scenarios, with zero background environment and the ability to tag events
    of interest within the existing experimental location at LHCb. The experiment
    fills a particular role in the ecosystem of experiments dedicated to studying
    LLPs at the LHC.
  question: What does the CODEX-b experiment do?
- answer: The HL-LHC stands for High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider. It is a future
    upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The HL-LHC aims to increase
    the luminosity of the LHC, allowing for more collisions and more precise measurements
    in particle physics research.
  question: What is the HL-LHC?
- answer: A muon collider is good at measuring Higgs couplings, but FCC-ee is even
    better due to its ability to provide the highest luminosities at lower center-of-mass
    energies, enabling very precise measurements including Higgs couplings determinations
    at the subpercent level.
  question: How good is the muon collide at measuring Higgs couplings? How about FCCee?
- answer: 'Based on the provided context, it is mentioned that the High-Luminosity
    LHC (HL-LHC) will dramatically expand the physics reach for Higgs physics. This
    expansion includes an increase in precision for most of the Higgs boson couplings
    measurements. Therefore, it is expected that HL-LHC will perform well in studying
    Higgs boson pairs (HH).


    As for Run 3 of the LHC, the context does not specifically mention the performance
    of HH studies in Run 3. However, it does mention that the LHC Run 3 will have
    nominal expectations for certain types of collisions and detector upgrades that
    will benefit the program. Therefore, while the details on HH studies in Run 3
    are not explicitly provided, the upgrades and increased luminosity may also contribute
    to advancements in Higgs physics.


    Regarding future colliders, the context does not mention any specific information
    about colliders beyond the HL-LHC. Therefore, it is not possible to determine
    if any future collider will perform better in studying HH compared to the HL-LHC.'
  question: How well will do on HH in Run 3? How about HL-LHC? Will any future collide
    do better?
- answer: IRIS-HEP (Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy
    Physics) and HEP-CCE (High Energy Physics Center for Computational Excellence)
    are initiatives focused on advancing software and computational capabilities in
    the field of High Energy Physics (HEP). These initiatives will likely contribute
    by developing and optimizing software tools, algorithms, and computational infrastructure
    needed for the data analysis and simulation challenges posed by the HL-LHC and
    other future collider experiments. They will work on enhancing data processing,
    storage, and analysis techniques to handle the increased data volumes and complexities
    expected from these experiments. Additionally, they may collaborate with other
    projects and institutions to ensure that the software and computational resources
    are ready and efficient for the upcoming collider experiments.
  question: What will IRIS-HEP and HEP-CCE do to help prepare for the HL-LHC?
- answer: Yes, there is ongoing work in the field of high-energy physics to evolve
    or rewrite existing toolkits and algorithms, including the use of machine learning
    techniques, to manage the increase in event complexity without increasing per-event
    reconstruction resource needs. This includes efforts to develop ML algorithms
    for experimental software and to identify event topologies of signals from data
    alone. Additionally, there are challenges in developing ML algorithms for use
    in trigger and data acquisition systems of future experiments, which includes
    the need for algorithms to run in on-detector electronics with very low latencies.
  question: Was there eny discussion of using ML to do complete event reconstruction?
- answer: The prospects of LLP (long-lived particle) searches at the HL-LHC are promising.
    The use of experiments like MATHUSLA, situated at CERN near the CMS detector,
    can significantly extend the sensitivity in long lifetime and LLP cross-section
    compared to the main LHC detectors alone. This can lead to the exploration of
    LLPs with lifetimes near the upper Big Bang Nucleosynthesis bound set by cosmology
    and play a vital role in the search for Dark Matter. The potential for exploring
    LLPs at the HL-LHC is significant, and it is recommended that future collider
    facilities consider the strong interest and need for searches for long-lived particles
    in their infrastructure plans.
  question: What are the prospects of LLP searches at the HL-LHC?
- answer: "The most recent Higgs-boson mass measurements from CMS and ATLAS set its\
    \ value to be 125.38 \xB1 0.14 GeV and 124.92 \xB1 0.21 GeV respectively. The\
    \ HL-LHC is expected to provide a measurement of the Higgs boson mass to 10-20\
    \ MeV precision, which is a significant improvement from the current uncertainties."
  question: What is the current Higgs mass? How much will the uncertainty improve
    with the HL-LHC?
- answer: "One new LLP model that could be explored at the HL-LHC is the model involving\
    \ the light scalar hD field with a sub-GeV mass, which couples to the Standard\
    \ Model (SM) via mixing with the SM Higgs. This model includes highly-displaced\
    \ decays of hDs produced in the far-forward region of the LHC, which can be effectively\
    \ searched for in FASER2. Additionally, the model incorporates an additional dark\
    \ vector field A\u2032 with a mass ranging from GeV to over 100 GeV, and the heavy\
    \ complex scalar dark matter (DM) candidate \u03C7."
  question: What is a new LLP model that we should be exploring at the hl LHC?
