questions:
- answer: The FASER experiment, along with its upgrade FASER2, is designed to search
    for light and weakly-interacting states, including long-lived particles, new force
    carriers, axion-like particles, light neutralinos, and dark sector particles.
    It aims to increase sensitivity by many orders of magnitude beyond previous experiments
    by detecting decays of new long-lived particles predicted by models of new physics.
  question: What does the FASER experiment do?
- answer: The MATHUSLA experiment is a proposed large-scale detector situated near
    the CMS detector at CERN. It is designed to reconstruct the decay of neutral Long-Lived
    Particles (LLPs) produced in HL-LHC collisions as displaced vertices in a near-zero-background
    environment. The experiment aims to detect decays of ultra long-lived neutral
    weakly interacting particles with proper lifetimes up to 10^7 - 10^8 meters, covering
    a wide range of lifetimes from the early Universe to the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.
  question: What does the MATHUSLA experiment do?
- answer: The ATLAS experiment, along with the CMS experiment, is used to search for
    direct evidence of new particles, pursue quantum imprints of new phenomena, and
    determine the nature of dark matter. These experiments are part of the High-Luminosity
    Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) project, which aims to reveal the secrets of the
    Higgs boson and address why it condensed in the universe.
  question: What does the ATLAS experiment do?
- answer: The CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is involved in releasing
    research-quality data, including reprocessed collision data and corresponding
    simulated data. It can be used for displaced vertex reconstruction and has shown
    optimistic results in certain studies. Additionally, CMS looks at emerging particles
    from the interaction region in a specific forward region with respect to the incoming
    beams, providing hints for possible Flavor Non-Universality.
  question: What does the CMS experiment do?
- answer: The LHCb experiment is optimized for flavor physics and explores rare flavor
    processes, matter-antimatter asymmetries in the charm sector, and searches for
    and studies pentaquarks, hidden sector particles, anomalous B meson decays, and
    more. It leverages the large b and c production cross-sections at the LHC to study
    particles produced at small angles to the beam, allowing it to be competitive
    with general-purpose detectors for some new particle searches.
  question: What does the LHCb experiment do?
- answer: The CODEX-b experiment aims to study long-lived particles (LLPs) by providing
    competitive sensitivity to a wide range of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) LLP
    scenarios. It operates in a zero-background environment and is designed to work
    in conjunction with the LHCb experiment, enabling joint searches between the two
    experiments. The experiment is relatively compact, affordable, and utilizes proven
    technology.
  question: What does the CODEX-b experiment do?
- answer: The HL-LHC stands for High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider. It is an upgrade
    of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) that aims to significantly increase the luminosity
    of the collisions, allowing for more precise measurements and the potential discovery
    of new particles or phenomena in high-energy physics.
  question: What is the HL-LHC?
- answer: The muon collider is good at measuring Higgs couplings, with precision at
    the permille level being the target for most proposed muon colliders. The FCC-ee
    collider is also capable of measuring Higgs couplings with smaller uncertainties
    compared to the HL-LHC due to various factors like precise calculations, better
    detector resolutions, and smaller background environments. However, for precision
    measurements at the few percent levels, colliders with partonic center-of-mass
    energies of around 10 TeV, such as the FCC-hh or a muon collider, would be required.
  question: How good is the muon collide at measuring Higgs couplings? How about FCCee?
- answer: "Based on the provided context, the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will significantly\
    \ expand the physics reach for Higgs physics. The HL-LHC program is expected to\
    \ extend the existing LHC program with proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass\
    \ energy of 14 TeV and an integrated luminosity of 3 ab\u22121. This will allow\
    \ for precise measurements of Higgs properties, top properties, rare processes\
    \ in the flavor sector, precision QCD measurements, and heavy ion related analyses.\n\
    \nTherefore, in terms of studying the Higgs boson (HH), the HL-LHC is expected\
    \ to perform much better than Run 3 of the LHC. The HL-LHC will have twenty times\
    \ the current available dataset, enabling more precise measurements and a broader\
    \ range of analyses related to the Higgs boson.\n\nAs for future colliders beyond\
    \ the HL-LHC, it is challenging to predict their performance without specific\
    \ information on the design and capabilities of those colliders."
  question: How well will do on HH in Run 3? How about HL-LHC? Will any future collide
    do better?
- answer: IRIS-HEP and HEP-CCE will work on developing a coherent vision and strategy
    with the LHC experiments to reduce time-to-insight for physicists analyzing data
    during the HL-LHC era. They will invest in infrastructure and services to support
    the construction of upgraded detectors and new Interaction Regions for the HL-LHC.
    Additionally, they will organize an "Analysis Grand Challenge" to test new concepts
    and prototypes of analysis facilities to prepare for the challenges presented
    by the HL-LHC.
  question: What will IRIS-HEP and HEP-CCE do to help prepare for the HL-LHC?
- answer: Yes, there is ongoing work in the collaborations to evolve or rewrite existing
    toolkits and algorithms focused on physics and technical performance at high event
    complexity, such as high pileup at HL-LHC, using machine learning techniques.
    Additionally, there are efforts to develop ML algorithms for use in trigger and
    data acquisition systems of future HEP experiments, which includes challenges
    like complete event reconstruction.
  question: Was there eny discussion of using ML to do complete event reconstruction?
- answer: The prospects of LLP (long-lived particle) searches at the HL-LHC are promising.
    Dedicated analyses of simplified models can lead to optimized search strategies,
    increasing the ability of LHC experiments to probe TeV-scale physics. Optimized
    cut-flows have shown to significantly increase the signal-to-background ratio
    over standard same-sign dilepton cuts. Searches for LLPs at the LHC far detectors
    are encouraged to develop a program to search for new physics, as observing only
    a few events could provide evidence supporting new discoveries.
  question: What are the prospects of LLP searches at the HL-LHC?
- answer: "The current Higgs boson mass is approximately 125.38 \xB1 0.14 GeV according\
    \ to CMS and 124.92 \xB1 0.21 GeV according to ATLAS. With the HL-LHC, the uncertainty\
    \ in the Higgs boson mass measurements is expected to improve significantly, allowing\
    \ for increased precision in most of the Higgs-boson coupling measurements."
  question: What is the current Higgs mass? How much will the uncertainty improve
    with the HL-LHC?
- answer: One example of a new LLP model that could be explored at the HL-LHC is the
    heavy neutral leptons. These are mentioned in the context as one of the models
    that carry over to other analyses and could be of interest for probing new physics
    with LLPs at higher energies.
  question: What is a new LLP model that we should be exploring at the hl LHC?
