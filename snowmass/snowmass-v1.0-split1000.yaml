questions:
- answer: "The FASER experiment, specifically FASER\u03BD, is designed to detect collider\
    \ neutrinos for the first time and study neutrino properties at TeV energies.\
    \ It is deployed on the beam collision axis at the LHC to maximize the interaction\
    \ rate of all three flavors of neutrinos and antineutrinos, allowing it to measure\
    \ the interaction cross sections in the unexplored high-energy range. The experiment\
    \ aims to explore new parameter space in the search for Beyond Standard Model\
    \ (BSM) physics."
  question: What does the FASER experiment do?
- answer: The MATHUSLA experiment has a large discovery potential by exploiting the
    beam of HL-LHC by placing a detector away from the collision point. It requires
    commitment from CERN for civil engineering, which is yet to be decided. If downsized,
    it would qualify as a candidate in the agile-experiment portfolio.
  question: What does the MATHUSLA experiment do?
- answer: The ATLAS experiment at the LHC is a general-purpose detector that searches
    for physics beyond the Standard Model. It is a nearly hermetic detector around
    the interaction point, designed to handle the high proton-proton collision rate
    produced by the LHC. The ATLAS experiment aims to explore various physics processes
    from different angles and energies, including the search for new particles and
    phenomena that could provide insights into fundamental questions about the universe.
  question: What does the ATLAS experiment do?
- answer: The CMS experiment, located at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN,
    is involved in high-energy physics research. It has made significant contributions,
    including the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012. The CMS experiment focuses
    on studying particle interactions, measuring properties of particles like the
    Higgs boson, and exploring new physics beyond the Standard Model.
  question: What does the CMS experiment do?
- answer: The LHCb experiment is optimized for flavor physics and focuses on studying
    the production and properties of b and c quarks. It aims to explore rare hyperon
    decays, matter-antimatter asymmetries in the charm sector, pentaquarks, hidden
    sector particles, anomalous B meson decays, and more. Additionally, LHCb provides
    complementary information to other experiments like ATLAS and CMS in studying
    key electroweak parameters and searching for heavy Majorana neutrinos and W lepton
    flavor-violating decays. The experiment has implemented a software trigger for
    real-time data processing, allowing for adjustments to the triggering algorithm
    and increased efficiency for hadronic channels.
  question: What does the LHCb experiment do?
- answer: I don't have information on the CODEX-b experiment.
  question: What does the CODEX-b experiment do?
- answer: The HL-LHC stands for High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider. It is the next
    phase of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) that will commence in 2029. The HL-LHC
    will dramatically increase the rate of particle collisions that can occur, allowing
    for more precise measurements of the properties of the Higgs Boson, probing the
    boundaries of the Standard Model further, and possibly observing new physics or
    pointing towards new discoveries. Upgraded detectors, advanced software, and computing
    technologies, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, will be
    utilized to handle the increased data and detect rare events more efficiently.
  question: What is the HL-LHC?
- answer: "The muon collider at \u221As = 125 GeV is not yet competitive in precision\
    \ and indirect sensitivity to new physics for measuring Higgs couplings. On the\
    \ other hand, the FCC-ee program is the only program leading to precision consistently\
    \ smaller than 1% for all couplings to gauge bosons and fermions, as well as for\
    \ the Higgs boson total width, and to a precision of a few percent for the Higgs\
    \ self-coupling."
  question: How good is the muon collide at measuring Higgs couplings? How about FCCee?
- answer: "In Run 3, it is expected that double Higgs production will not be observed,\
    \ but it may be possible to set an upper limit on the di-Higgs production cross-section\
    \ closer to the Standard Model value. The Higgs self-coupling measurement is out\
    \ of reach for Run 3. \n\nIn the HL-LHC phase, which is scheduled to start in\
    \ 2029, there will be a significant increase in integrated luminosity, allowing\
    \ for the study of phenomena that have been elusive due to their small rates.\
    \ The HL-LHC program is expected to provide unprecedented data sets that could\
    \ lead to direct discoveries and potentially revolutionize our understanding of\
    \ nature.\n\nFuture colliders beyond the HL-LHC are not discussed in the provided\
    \ context, so it is not possible to determine if any future collider will perform\
    \ better in terms of studying double Higgs production and Higgs self-couplings."
  question: How well will do on HH in Run 3? How about HL-LHC? Will any future collide
    do better?
- answer: IRIS-HEP and HEP-CCE are collaborating to help prepare for the HL-LHC by
    evolving the international HEP computing infrastructure, software, and services.
    They are conducting integration tests, such as the "Grand Challenge," to test
    all components and stress computational performance and tool integration. Additionally,
    they are working on developing new techniques for service delivery and coordinating
    research activities within the HEP community to reduce time-to-insight for physicists
    analyzing data during the HL-LHC era.
  question: What will IRIS-HEP and HEP-CCE do to help prepare for the HL-LHC?
- answer: Yes, there was a discussion of using modern machine learning techniques
    to significantly improve the physics reach of high-resolution tracking calorimeters.
    Techniques such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Panoptic Segmentation are
    currently under investigation for event reconstruction. For example, the Exa.TrkX
    collaboration is developing GNN techniques for LArTPC event reconstruction to
    reconstruct high-energy interactions efficiently and reject background candidates
    based on event kinematics. This approach operates directly on detector hits, assigning
    semantic labels based on patterns learned from simulated neutrino interactions.
  question: Was there eny discussion of using ML to do complete event reconstruction?
- answer: The prospects for Long-Lived Particle (LLP) searches at the High-Luminosity
    Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) are promising. The upgrades to the detector and
    trigger systems will expand the reach of searches for displaced leptons and jets,
    providing new sensitivity to long-lived particles with hadronic final states.
    Additionally, new detectors like pico-second-precision timing detectors and advanced
    tracking systems will enable better targeting of new physics with challenging
    signatures. Overall, the HL-LHC program can be enhanced by further searches and
    studies of different LLP scenarios.
  question: What are the prospects of LLP searches at the HL-LHC?
- answer: The current uncertainty on the Higgs mass is approximately 240 MeV. With
    the HL-LHC, it is expected that the measurement of the Higgs boson mass will improve
    to a precision of 10-20 MeV, significantly reducing the impact of uncertainty
    on related measurements.
  question: What is the current Higgs mass? How much will the uncertainty improve
    with the HL-LHC?
- answer: One new LLP model that has gained attention is the "Neutral Naturalness"
    paradigm, which emerged around 2015. This model can explain the stability of the
    weak scale without colored matter at TeV energies. It is based on older models
    like the Twin Higgs and Folded Supersymmetry, but it was realized in 2015 that
    LLPs are generic predictions in this set of models. This paradigm has led to a
    vibrant community of theorists and experimentalists working on LLPs, culminating
    in an extensive review of the LLP landscape.
  question: What is a new LLP model that we should be exploring at the hl LHC?
