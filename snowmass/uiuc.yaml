questions:
  - question: "What does the FASER experiment do?"
    answer: "The FASER (ForwArd Search ExpeRiment) experiment is designed to explore the forward region of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and search for 
            new physics signals that can be uniquely probed in that region. It aims to detect long-lived particles (LLPs) that may be produced in high-energy 
            proton-proton collisions at the LHC. The FASER experiment is already set to probe new parameter space in the search for Beyond the 
            Standard Model (BSM) physics, but the overall size of FASER is limited by the available space underground. Therefore, an enlarged detector 
            called FASER2 has been proposed to improve the sensitivity and reach of the experiment. FASER2 will have a larger decay volume and improved 
            capabilities to study LLPs and neutrinos, as well as search for dark matter and other new particles. The detector design for FASER2 is a work 
            in progress, and the current status of the experiment is described in Chapter 3 of the 
            document 'The Forward Physics Facility at the High-Luminosity LHC'"
  - question: "What does the MATHUSLA experiment do?"
    answer: "The MATHUSLA (MAssive Timing Hodoscope for Ultra-Stable neutraL
            pArticles) experiment is designed to detect long-lived particles(LLPs) that
            may be produced in high-energy proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron
            Collider (LHC). It aims to study LLPs that have lifetimes in the range of
            nanoseconds to seconds and travel a significant distance before decaying.
            MATHUSLA consists of a large, surface-level detector located above the
            ATLAS or CMS experiments, which allows it to capture LLPs that escape the
            main detectors. The experiment focuses on LLPs that are weakly interacting
            and have low backgrounds, making it sensitive to a wide range of new
            physics scenarios beyond the Standard Model. The MATHUSLA detector is
            designed to have excellent timing resolution and high efficiency for
            detecting LLPs, and it can provide complementary information to the main
            LHC experiments. The current status and future prospects of the MATHUSLA
            experiment are described in the document 'An Update to the Letter of Intent
            for MATHUSLA: Search for Long-Lived Particles at the HL-LHC'"
  - question: "What does the ATLAS experiment do?"
    answer: "The ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) experiment is one of the major
            experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Its primary goal is to
            study the fundamental particles and forces that make up the universe. ATLAS
            is designed to detect and measure the properties of particles produced in
            high-energy proton-proton collisions at the LHC. It consists of various
            sub-detectors, including a tracking detector, calorimeters, and a muon
            spectrometer, which work together to reconstruct and identify particles.
            The ATLAS experiment has made significant contributions to the discovery of
            the Higgs boson in 2012 [1]

            physics. Relevant Sources: [Observation of a new particle in the search for the Standard Model Higgs boson with the ATLAS detector at the LHC](#1: 1207.7214)"
  - question: "What does the CMS experiment do?"
    answer: "The CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) experiment is one of the major
            experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Its primary goal is to
            study the fundamental particles and forces that make up the universe. CMS
            is designed to detect and measure the properties of particles produced in

            of the Higgs boson, and the investigation of phenomena beyond the Standard
            Model of particle physics."
  - question: "What does the LHCb experiment do?"
    answer: "The LHCb (Large Hadron Collider beauty) experiment is one of the
            major experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Its primary focus is
            the study of particles containing the beauty (b) quark, also known as the
            bottom quark. LHCb is designed to investigate the physics of CP violation
            and rare decays of particles containing b quarks, which can provide
            insights into the nature of matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe.
            The experiment aims to measure the properties of these particles with high
            precision and search for new physics phenomena beyond the Standard Model.
            LHCb has a unique forward geometry, allowing it to detect particles
            produced in the forward direction, which is particularly advantageous for
            studying the decays of short-lived strange particles and measuring rare
            decays into opposite-sign muon pairs. The experiment has made significant
            contributions to the study of CP violation and the measurement of rare
            decays. It continues to explore a wide range of physics topics, including
            the search for new particles and the study of the properties of the Higgs
            boson."
  - question: "What does the CODEX-b experiment do?"
    answer: "The provided documents do not contain information about the CODEX-b experiment."
  - question: "What is the HL-LHC?" 
    answer: "The HL-LHC stands for the
              High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider. It is an upgrade of the existing
              Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The HL-LHC project aims to increase
              the luminosity of the LHC by a factor of 10, which will allow for more
              precise measurements of known particles and the potential discovery of new
              particles or phenomena. The upgrade involves several technical
              improvements, including the installation of new magnets, upgrades to the
              accelerator and detector systems, and improvements in the data acquisition
              and analysis capabilities. The HL-LHC is expected to start operations in
              the late 2020s and will continue to push the boundaries of particle physics
              research. "
  - question: "How good is the muon collide at measuring Higgs couplings? How
    about FCCee?" 
    answer: "The muon collider and FCC-ee both have their
      strengths when it comes to measuring Higgs couplings. The muon collider has
      the advantage of a much larger cross section for s-channel Higgs boson
      production compared to FCC-ee. This means that the muon collider can
      produce a larger number of Higgs bosons, allowing for more precise
      measurements of the Higgs couplings. In particular, the muon collider can
      provide an exquisite precision of 0.1 MeV for the Higgs boson mass and a
      precision of 0.25 MeV for the Higgs boson total width 
    

      On the other hand, FCC-ee is an excellent low-energy e+e Higgs factory. It can
      measure the total width of the Higgs boson with a precision of 1.2%, which is
      the best precision on the market. FCC-ee also provides a 3% sensitivity to the
      Higgs self-coupling, which can be determined from the precise measurement of
      the single-Higgs production cross section as a function of s [1]


      In summary, the muon collider is better suited for measuring the Higgs couplings
      due to its larger cross section for Higgs boson production. However, FCC-ee is
      still an excellent Higgs factory and can provide precise measurements of the
      Higgs couplings, especially the total width and the self-coupling.

  - question: "How well will do on HH in Run 3? How about HL-LHC? Will any
    future collide do better?" 
    answer: "Based on the provided documents, the
    sensitivity to Higgs boson (HH) production and measurements is expected to
    improve in Run 3 of the LHC and the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) [2, 11].
    The HL-LHC is projected to dramatically expand the physics reach for Higgs
    physics, with estimates of achieving 2-4% precision on the couplings to W,
    Z, and third-generation fermions [2].
    However, it is important to note that the couplings to first and
    second-generation fermions will still largely not be accessible, and the
    self-coupling of the Higgs boson will only be probed with approximately 50%
    precision [2].    

    In terms of future colliders, the FCC-ee (Future Circular
    Collider-electron-positron) is expected to provide a high-precision measurement
    of the Higgs boson couplings, particularly to the Z boson [1]
    The ILC (International Linear Collider) and CLIC (Compact Linear Collider) are
    also proposed linear colliders that aim to improve the precision of Higgs boson
    couplings [1]
    These linear colliders are expected to be more effective at higher energies,
    while circular colliders like the FCC-ee are more efficient at lower energies
    [1]

    Overall, while the HL-LHC and future colliders like the FCC-ee, ILC, and CLIC
    are expected to improve the precision of Higgs boson measurements, each
    collider has its own strengths and limitations in terms of energy range and
    measurement capabilities. It is important to consider the specific physics
    goals and requirements when evaluating the performance of each collider for HH
    production and measurements.

  - question: "What will IRIS-HEP and HEP-CCE do to help prepare for the
    HL-LHC?" 
    answer: "According to the document 'HL-LHC Computing Review Stage
    2, Common Software Projects: Data Science Tools for Analysis' [15],
    IRIS-HEP and HEP-CCE are actively involved in the development and support
    of core software and computing projects to prepare for the HL-LHC. 

    IRIS-HEP, in particular, is funding the development of core pieces of the
    ecosystem and is focused on the development goals that align with the needs of
    the HL-LHC. They are working collaboratively with other teams and individuals
    to build up the data science/HEP interoperability ecosystem. Communication and
    collaboration are facilitated through channels such as PyHEP Gitter, IRIS-HEP
    Slack, and GitHub issues/pull requests.

    The document also mentions that progress in preparing for the HL-LHC is measured
    in terms of physics analysis productivity in current LHC analyses, rather than
    raw computational performance. IRIS-HEP is conducting an institute-wide Grand
    Challenge to test the integration of all its components, including data
    processing and analysis tasks that scale up to the expected throughput and
    features of HL-LHC data processing.

    In summary, IRIS-HEP and HEP-CCE are actively involved in the development and
    coordination of software and computing projects to prepare for the HL-LHC. They
    are focused on building an interoperable ecosystem, fostering collaboration,
    and conducting integration tests to ensure the readiness of the software and
    computing infrastructure for the challenges of the HL-LHC.

  - question: "Was there eny discussion of using ML to do complete event
    reconstruction?" 
    answer: " Yes, there was discussion of using machine
    learning (ML) techniques for event reconstruction in the provided
    documents. In document 5, it is mentioned that experiments have started
    making limited use of ML algorithms for anomaly detection [5]
    In document 6, it is mentioned that ML algorithms can be used to manage the
    increase in event complexity without increasing per-event reconstruction
    resource needs [6]
    Additionally, document 8 discusses the use of ML algorithms for quark-gluon
    discrimination in the L1 trigger system [8]
    These discussions indicate that ML techniques are being explored for event
    reconstruction in high-energy physics.

  - question: "What are the prospects of LLP searches at the HL-LHC?" 
    answer: "The prospects for long-lived particle (LLP) searches at the High-Luminosity
    LHC (HL-LHC) are discussed in document 1 [1]
    The HL-LHC is expected to provide many more search results from the LHC
    collaborations using the full Run 2 dataset. While the methods described in
    the document have not been applied yet to collider data, there are plans to
    organize efforts for LLP searches at the HL-LHC. The ATLAS Collaboration
    has already produced a first version of the CWoLa hunting analysis using
    low-dimensional features, which is likely the start of a growing set of
    searches. The organization of physics analysis groups at the LHC, such as
    SUSY, Top, Higgs, SM, B physics, Exotics/Exotica, B2G/HDBS, Model Agnostic,
    Weakly Supervised, (Semi) Supervised, Unsupervised, Statistics forum, ML
    forum, Measurement Groups, Search Groups, and Supporting organizations,
    will play a crucial role in organizing and coordinating these efforts. The
    document also mentions the importance of theoretical input and the role of
    theorists in guiding the search strategies. Overall, the HL-LHC presents a
    promising opportunity for LLP searches, and further developments and
    collaborations are expected to enhance the prospects in the coming years.

  - question: "What is the current Higgs mass? How much will the uncertainty
    improve with the HL-LHC?" 
    answer: "The current Higgs boson mass is approximately 125 GeV [1]
    With the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), the uncertainty in the Higgs boson
    mass is expected to improve from the current level of 32 MeV to 22 MeV [16]
    This improvement is due to the increased statistics and improved detector
    performance at the HL-LHC [9]"
  - question: "What is a new LLP model that we should be exploring at the hl
    LHC?" 
    answer: "Based on the provided documents, there is no specific
    mention of a new LLP model that should be explored at the HL-LHC. The
    documents primarily focus on the physics reach and potential discoveries at
    future colliders such as the FCC-ee and muon colliders. However, it is
    important to note that the HL-LHC itself provides opportunities for
    exploring LLPs, and there are ongoing efforts to study LLP signatures at
    the LHC. It would be beneficial to consult additional sources or research
    papers specifically focused on LLP models and their potential at the
    HL-LHC.
